      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <!-- Allow multi‑paragraph summaries by preserving line breaks in TMC Enviro completed the installation of two heavy-duty steel gates at the entry and exit points of the reopened access road between Walkers Road and Walls Road, Macedon, Victoria. The works included compliance with V/Line specifications for emergency vehicle access, underground cable protection measures, and provision for future bollards. The project was delivered following thorough planning, stakeholder coordination, and the use of non-destructive digging methods to protect existing underground assets.

Key project details:
- Project: 2611 - V/Line Woodend Access Track Gates
- Status: Completed
- Location: Macedon, Victoria (Quarry Road, Macedon, Victoria, 3440, Australia)
- Date Completed: 2025-07-11
- PO/LOE: (not provided)
- KP Range: 74.670 – 76.114

Completion Notes:
TMC Enviro successfully installed two heavy-duty steel gates at the entry and exit points of the reopened access road between Walkers Road and Walls Road. The gates meet the V/Line-specified minimum opening width of 3.5 metres to allow emergency vehicle access, including fire trucks. Provision for future bollards was also included, and V/Line will supply the locks as arranged.

Underground Cable Protection Measures:
- Prior to works commencing, Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) reports were obtained and local cable location contractors were engaged.
- These investigations identified the presence of Optus Optical Fibre and VicTrack underground cables within the work zone.
- Non-destructive digging (NDD) methods were employed for all post hole excavations to ensure asset protection.

Gate components were fabricated off-site in advance. The installation phase was completed over two days following several weeks of planning and stakeholder coordination to ensure safe and compliant delivery.

Key Findings:
- Two heavy-duty steel gates were installed at both ends of the access road between Walkers Road and Walls Road.
- Gates meet V/Line's minimum 3.5 metre opening width for emergency vehicle access.
- Non-destructive digging methods were used to protect Optus Optical Fibre and VicTrack underground cables.
- Provision for future bollards was included in the installation.
- V/Line will supply the locks for the gates as arranged. -->
